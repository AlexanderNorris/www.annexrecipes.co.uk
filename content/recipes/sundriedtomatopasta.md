## Ingredients
- 100g sun-dried tomatoes
- 120g ricotta
- 10g fresh basil
- 30g grated parmesan, extra for serving
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 Garlic cloves
- salt & pepper, to taste

- 300g pasta (eg spaghetti), 4 servings

## Directions
1. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, ricotta, olive oil, basil, garlic, parmesan, and salt & peper (to taste) to a food processor and blend to a coarse consistency. Set the tomato pesto aside until the pasta is done.
2. Boil some salty water in a pot and cook the pasta (~9 mins for spaghetti).
3. Drain the pasta, but reserve some water (~1/2 cup).
4. Return the pasta to the pot and mix in the tomato pesto, adding some pasta water as needed to achieve a silky sauce consistency.
5. Serve with fresh ground black pepper and grated parmesan.
