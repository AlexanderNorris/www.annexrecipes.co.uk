## Ingredients
### Stuffed Peppers
- 2 large peppers (poblano or sweet pointed peppers)
- 1/2 can of Black beans, drained
- 1 tsp ground Cumin
- 0.5 tsp chilli powder
- ~100g Cheddar (or Mexican queso fresco), grated

### Rancheros Sauce
- 4 medium tomatoes (roma or vine-ripened), halved
- 2 Jalapenos, halved
- 6 cloves of Garlic, peeled
- 1 Onion, slived into wedges
- 1 tsp salt
- 0.5 tsp Black pepper
- 2 tbsp Olive oil
- 2 tsp ground Cumin
- 1 tsp ground Coriander
- 1 tsp Chilli powder
- 1 tsp dried Oregano
- 1 tbsp Tomato paste
- 190g Vegetable stock

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 200c.
2. Line a tray with baking paper and arrange the peppers, tomatoes, jalapenos, garlic, and onion wedges on the tray. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
3. Roast in the oven for 30 mins, checking after 15 mins. The peppers might be ready first, so remove and let cool once starting to blister.
4. Once the tomatoes, jalapenos, garlic, and onion are blistered and soft, remove from the oven and allow to cool.
5. Once cooled, put aside a 1/3 of the onion and chop it up. Add the rest of the rancheros ingredients (included the juices) to a blender with the rancheros spices, tomato paste, and half the stock. Blend until smoothing, adding more stock to thin out the sauce.
6. In a bowl, mix the black beans with cumin, chilli powder, cheese, and the reserve 1/3 of the roasted onion. Season with salt and pepper. 
7. Carefully slit the peppers and remove the insides.
8. Stuff the peppers with the black bean mixture.
9. Cook some rice to serve with the peppers.
10. Pour some of the rancheros sauce into a baking dish and place the stuffed peppers on top. Drizzle more of the sauce over the peppers and cover with tin foil.
11. Bake for 20-25 mins (until the filling is hot and melty).
12. Uncover and bake for 5 mins.
13. Serve with rice.
