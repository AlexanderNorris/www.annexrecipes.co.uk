4. Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan. 
5. Add the rice to the vegetables and stir until coated in the butter and oil. 
6. Pour in the wine, stirring from time to time, and allow the liquid to evaporate. 
7. Stir in the sundried tomatoes.
8. Add a ladleful of stock to the rice at a time, stir and allow to evaporate before adding more.   
7. Once the stock has been used up, take off the heat, add the parmesan, season to taste, and scatter the spinach over the risotto. 
8. Cover and leave it for 5 mins.
9. Remove the lid and stir. 
10. Serve up the risotto and sprinkle with some parmesan, if deired.
