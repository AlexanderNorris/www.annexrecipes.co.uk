## Ingredients
- 1 small onion, diced 
- 1 celery stick, diced
- 1 small carrot, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed 
- 120g asparagus (optional), sliced into 3-4cm pieces
- 100g frozen broad beans
- 75g frozen petits pois (or peas)
- 175g risotto rice (eg arborio)
- 750g vegetable stock
- 50ml dry white wine (eg Riesling or Pinot grigio)
- 40g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative) 
- 75ml untalted butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt & pepper to taste

### Possible alternatives / additions
- 250g mushrooms (chestnut, shitake, porcini, or a mix)
- 1 sprig of mint, chopped - add at the end
- 1 sprig of parsley, chopped - add at the end
- replace some the risotto rice with wild rice
- replace some of the risotto rice with Camargue rice 
- replace some/all vegetable stock with mushroom stock (soak a handful of dried mushrooms, eg porcini, in hot water for 20 mins. Use the water as stock and add the rehydrated mushrooms to the risotto)

## Directions
1. Heat the olive oil and 50g of the butter in a cast iron casserole dish (or heavy-based saucepan with a lid) until the butter has melted.
2. Add the mirepoix (onion, cellery, carrot), and garlic. Cook on a low heat for about 10 mins until softened.
3. Add the stock to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. If using the asparagus, add it to the stock and cook for a few mins until al dente; remove the asparagus and put aside.
4. Add the rice to the vegetables and stir until coated in the butter and oil. Pour in the wine, stir, and allow the liquid to evaporate (approx. 1-2 mins).
5. Add a ladleful of stock to the rice at a time, stir and allow to evaporate before adding more.   
6. Once about half the stock has been used up, add the broad beans and petits pois (and mushrooms, if using) and stir through.
7. Keep stirring occasionally and adding the stock until all used up. Add the asparagus (if using).
8. Take off the heat, add most of the parmesan (~30g) and the remaining butter. Stir, put the lid on and leave it for 5 mins.
9. Remove the lid, stir, and add the fresh herbs if using.
10. Serve up the risotto and finish with the remaining parmesan.
