## Ingredients
- 150g digestive biscuits
- 50g butter  
- 500g cream cheese / marscapone
- 300ml double cream
- 100g icing sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Alterations
- replace digestive biscuits with oreos (remove the filling though)
- replace vanilla extract with almond extract
- malteasers can be replaced with;
    - oreos
    - kinder bueno 
    - ~40g cocoa powder and top with a thin layer of caramel sauce, followed by some dark chocolate (grated or melted and drissled over the top) for a millionaire's shortbread styled cheesecake

## Directions
1. Grease and line a loose-bottomed cake tin (~22cm tin) with parchment 
2. Crush the biscuits to create a crumb.
3. Melt the butter.
4. Mix the biscuit crumbs and butter until fully combined and add to the cake tin. Press down firmly to create an even base and chill in the fridge - this will help it to set.
5. Whip the double cream to stiff peaks.
6. Mix the icing sugar, cream cheese, vanilla exstract, and crushed malteasers. Then fold in the double cream and mix until combined.
7. Spoon the mixture over your biscuit base and smooth it out. At this point you can decorate the cheesecake with more malteasers.
8. Refrigerate for at least an hour. After this you can remove it from the cake tin and serve on a plate.
